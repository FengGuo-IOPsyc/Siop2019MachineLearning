### The is the SIOP Machine Learning Competion code from Team Procustination ###
Team Name: Team Procrustination, Bowling Green State University
Team Members: Feng Guo, Nicholas Howald, Marie Childers, Jordan Dovel, Sami Nesnidal, Andrew Samo & Samuel McAbee


Our solution is Ensemble model (i.e., weighted average on ridge regressions) from
         ###  Uni & Bi-gram Bag-of-Words  + Doc2Vec  ###

The code is clean and has been tested; make sure all the related packages/modules were installed correctly if you want to run the code. As the seed was not pre-determined, the exact same results cannot be reached repeatedly. However, the differences should be little that can be ignored. 

If you have any questions regarding the codes or our solution, feel free to contact Feng Guo (fguo@bgsu.edu)
